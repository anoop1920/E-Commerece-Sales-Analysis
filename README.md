## Key Insights:
- Lowest performing states do not have sellers from their own states so the delivery time is increased which affects customer satisfaction.So theres need to increase sellers in each state.
- In recent months of 2018 lead Delivery time has gone in negative even for high performing states which in turn causes low coustomer acqusition and may lead to losing of customers.
- Max undelivered orders had credit card as payment type followed by boleto then vouchers.So they can check the system.
- Most of states most ordered product is not delivered from same state.So need to find sellers for that particular product in same states.
- Ramiro  lowest performing state has average reply time for complaint of 198 hours whereas other states its around 35-70 hours.Also other state AP has overall average reply time of 104 hours whereas others have of about 75-90 which is also high.Replying time to complaints as well as other reviews must be reduced.
- Most sequentials are paid in vouchers with most of customers opting for 2 sequentials.
